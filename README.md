# StudyApp
This is an app that is created for students who want to become more productive and keep track of their study patterns, myself included. With this study timer the user can set the timer for how long they want to study (E.g. 60 Minutes) and when the countdown is over, the app will save the date and the duration of your study session into the database, which you can review later. The app also calcualtes the total amount of time that you have spent on studying.

There are many more features that I would like to add to the app. For example, adding the subject for which the user studies into the database might make the app more informative. Or maybe add some animation when the timer is running, just to make the app more pleasant to use. More features will definitely be added to this app in the future. 

I have been using this app to make myself more productive. It is amazing to be able to build something that I need. :)
